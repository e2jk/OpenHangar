# Rebases the current branch onto the latest origin/main — any commits from
# a previous round that already landed there are dropped automatically (git
# recognizes their patch is already applied and skips them; this is the same
# mechanism `git pull --rebase` relies on) — then pushes to the `ship`
# branch. That push triggers .github/workflows/auto-pr-merge.yml, which
# opens (or reuses) a PR to main and enables auto-merge: it lands on its own
# once CI is green, no waiting around and no separate manual sync needed
# before your next round of commits — just run this script again.
