Ideas that were considered but deferred. Not prioritised, not scheduled.

## Demo: dynamic slot expansion

When all demo slots are busy (current behaviour: show a "demo full" page with HTTP 503),
automatically create additional slots on demand instead of turning visitors away.

Possible approach:
- When the LRU slot is still warm, provision N extra slots (e.g. 20 more) by calling the
  same `seed_fleet()` helper used by the regular seed.
- Track dynamically-created slots separately so the wipe/refresh script can clean them up
  without disturbing the base pool.
- Cap total slots via a `DEMO_MAX_SLOTS` env var to avoid unbounded growth under traffic spikes.

Why deferred: 20 concurrent demo users is generous for current traffic levels, and the
added complexity (variable slot counts, wipe-script changes, cap enforcement) is not
justified yet.
