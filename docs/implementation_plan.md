# OpenHangar — Implementation Plan

Phases are meant to be delivered incrementally.
Each phase produces something usable end-to-end before the next one adds depth.
Check boxes are ticked as items are completed.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅

- [x] Project structure, Docker Compose, dev/prod entrypoint
- [x] Flask app factory, environment validation (`FLASK_ENV`)
- [x] PostgreSQL integration (`db.create_all`, dev seed)
- [x] Authentication: setup wizard (account + optional TOTP), login (two-step), logout
- [x] Multi-tenant DB schema (`Tenant`, `User`, `TenantUser`, roles)
- [x] Three-state home page: landing (fresh install) / welcome (initialised) / dashboard (logged in)
- [x] Navbar adapts to auth state; env badge for dev/test
- [x] pytest suite with SQLite in-memory fixtures

---

## Phase 1 — Aircraft & Component Models (DB only) ✅

Goal: define the core domain models before building any UI,
so every later phase has a stable foundation to build on.

- [x] `Aircraft` model — registration, make/model, year, placeholder flag, tenant FK
- [x] `Component` model — generic typed component linked to an aircraft
  - `type` stored as plain string (no DB enum) so new types never require a migration
  - Built-in types in `ComponentType`: `engine`, `propeller`, `avionics`
  - `position` field for multi-engine aircraft ("left" / "right" / …)
  - `time_at_install` (hours on component when installed)
  - `installed_at` / `removed_at` lifecycle dates — `removed_at = NULL` means currently installed
  - `extras` JSON column for type-specific attributes (blade count, TBO, firmware version, …)
- [x] DB tables created via `create_all` (Alembic migrations deferred to Phase 2+)
- [x] Unit tests for model relationships, constraints, history tracking, and cascade deletes
- [x] Extend dev seed with sample aircraft (single-engine and multi-engine) with components attached

---

## Phase 2 — Aircraft Management (basic CRUD) ✅

Goal: a user can add planes and attach an engine and propeller through the UI.

- [x] Aircraft list page (per tenant) — shows registration, type, status placeholder
- [x] Add aircraft form — registration, make/model, year (components can be added after)
- [x] Aircraft detail page — shows linked components grouped by type
- [x] Add/edit component form linked to an aircraft
- [x] Delete aircraft (with cascade to components)
- [x] Basic auth guard — `login_required` decorator redirects unauthenticated users to login
- [x] Extend dev seed with a realistic fleet: 2–3 aircraft with engines, propellers, and one multi-engine example (done in Phase 1 seed)

---

## Phase 3 — Basic Flight Logging ✅

Goal: a user can record a flight against an aircraft.
Minimal fields only; logbook refinement comes later.

- [x] `FlightEntry` model — aircraft FK, date, departure airfield, arrival airfield, hobbs start/end
- [x] Log flight form (one page, minimal fields)
- [x] Flight list per aircraft (date, route, hobbs delta)
- [x] Aircraft total hobbs derived automatically from flight entries
- [x] Route tests for flight creation and listing
- [x] Extend dev seed with a plausible flight history (≥ 10 entries spread across aircraft)

---

## Phase 4 — Basic Maintenance Tracking ✅

Goal: define when maintenance is due (by date or by hours) and see its status.

- [x] `MaintenanceTrigger` model — aircraft FK, name, type (calendar / hours), threshold value
- [x] `MaintenanceRecord` model — trigger FK, date performed, notes
- [x] Add trigger form (hard date or N hours since last service)
- [x] Trigger list per aircraft — shows OK / due soon / overdue based on current hobbs or date
- [x] Mark trigger as serviced (creates a `MaintenanceRecord`)
- [x] Route tests for trigger CRUD and status calculation
- [x] Extend dev seed with maintenance triggers in all three states: OK, due soon, and overdue

---

## Phase 5 — Real Dashboard ✅

Goal: replace placeholder cards with live data.

- [x] Fleet overview — real list of aircraft with computed status colour
- [x] Per-aircraft status: green (all OK) / yellow (due ≤ 30 days or ≤ 10% hours) / red (overdue)
- [x] Recent flights panel — last 5 flights per aircraft
- [x] Upcoming maintenance panel — next 5 items sorted by urgency
- [x] Quick stats — total aircraft, flights this month, open alerts
- [x] Verify dev seed covers all dashboard states: at least one aircraft green, one yellow, one red

---

## Phase 6 — Public Demo Deployment ✅

Goal: publish the app as a live demo anyone can try without signing up.
See [`docs/demo-deployment.md`](demo-deployment.md) for the full technical spec.

- [x] Add `demo` as a valid `FLASK_ENV` value (entrypoint + app validation)
- [x] In demo mode: always show landing page to unauthenticated visitors (skip the "welcome back" state)
- [x] Landing page CTA replaced by "Try the demo" button → `POST /demo/enter` — no login form, no credentials
- [x] Logout in demo mode returns to landing page; `demo_slot_id` preserved in session so the same slot is restored on re-entry
- [x] One isolated tenant per demo slot (20 slots); visitor is silently assigned a free slot via session
- [x] Demo mode restrictions: no new-user creation, no password/TOTP changes
- [x] Demo seed script — reuses dev seed fleet data (`_seed_helpers.py`) multiplied across all 20 slots
- [x] Wipe-and-refresh script (`demo/refresh.sh`) callable by cron:
  - Checks GHCR for a newer image; pulls and rebuilds if found
  - Always wipes the demo DB and restarts the container fresh with demo seed
  - Prunes dangling Docker images after each pull to prevent disk exhaustion
  - Bundled inside the Docker image (`/app/demo-scripts/`) and exported to the host via bind-mount on container start; cron always runs the version shipped with the current image
- [x] Pre-wipe banner: if any slot had a login in the last 20 min, show countdown to next wipe
- [x] Configure a URL for the "Get Started" button on the landing page that gets published as a GitHub page to point to a published demo website. If not defined, the "Get Started" button must be deactivated there (nothing to get started with...)
- [x] GHCR CI workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) — publish image on every merge to `main`
- [x] Extend demo seed with rich data so the app looks lived-in on first visit

---

## Phase 7 — Logbook & Flight Detail Expansion ✅

Goal: upgrade flight entries to full logbook quality.

- [x] Additional flight fields — pilot (free text), duration (auto-calculated), notes
- [x] Tach start/end (separate from hobbs)
- [x] Hobbs/tach photo attachment (file upload, stored locally)
- [x] Airframe logbook view — all entries for an aircraft
- [x] Engine logbook view — entries for a specific engine (hours since new / since last overhaul)
- [x] Propeller logbook view — entries for a specific propeller
- [x] Extend dev seed flight entries with pilot names, notes, and tach data

---

## Phase 8 — Cost Tracking ✅

Goal: track what it costs to operate each aircraft.

- [x] `Expense` model — aircraft FK, date, type (fuel / parts / insurance / other), amount, unit (L/gal/€/$)
- [x] Add expense form (per flight or standalone)
- [x] Expense list per aircraft — filterable by type and period
- [x] Cost-per-hour calculation over a configurable period (default 12 months)
- [x] Fuel cost per flight (optionally entered at log-flight time)
- [x] Extend dev seed with a year of mixed expense records (fuel, parts, insurance) across aircraft

---

## Phase 9 — Document & Photo Uploads ✅

Goal: attach documents and photos to aircraft, components, and log entries.

- [x] `Document` model — owner type (aircraft / component / entry), file path, metadata, sensitive flag
- [x] Upload form (drag-and-drop on desktop, camera on mobile)
- [x] Document list per aircraft/component — visible/sensitive toggle
- [x] Sensitive documents hidden from viewer/renter roles
- [x] Storage path configurable via env var (host-mounted volume)
- [x] Extend dev seed with placeholder document records (files bundled in the repo under `dev_seed_docs/`)

---

## Phase 10 — Backup & Restore ✅

Goal: automated daily encrypted backup so operators can recover from data loss.

- [x] Encrypted ZIP produced by a scheduled job (key from env var)
- [x] Backup written to a configurable host-mounted folder
- [x] Uploaded documents included in the ZIP under `uploads/`
- [x] `BackupRecord` model — path, timestamp, checksum
- [x] Restore procedure documented in `docs/`
- [x] Extend dev seed with a seeded `BackupRecord` to verify the backup list UI renders correctly

---

## Phase 11 — Read-only Share Link ✅

Goal: share a live, passwordless view of an aircraft's status with people who have no
account — e.g. a maintenance shop, a visiting pilot, or a club notice board.

- [x] `ShareToken` model — aircraft FK, random 8-char token, access level (summary / full), created_at, revoked_at
- [x] Public route `GET /share/<token>` — no login required; returns 404 for unknown or revoked tokens
- [x] Two access levels: **summary** (status badges, maintenance item names only) and **full** (adds due dates, hobbs values, recent flights and non-sensitive documents)
- [x] Page served with `X-Robots-Tag` header and `<meta>` tag to prevent crawler indexing
- [x] Token management UI on the aircraft detail page: generate (modal with access level choice), view active tokens, revoke
- [x] QR code generated server-side (`qrcode` library), downloadable as PNG
- [x] Dev seed: OO-PNH with a summary token, OO-ABC with a full token
- [x] Route tests: valid token, revoked token, access-level gating, noindex header, QR endpoint

---

## Phase 12 — Snag List ("Open Ends") ✅

Goal: pilots can log defects noticed during or after a flight so the next crew is
aware of known issues before departure, and mechanics know what needs fixing.

- [x] `Snag` model — aircraft FK, title, description, reporter, reported_at, resolved_at, grounding flag
- [x] Aircraft gains a derived "grounded" state when any unresolved grounding snag exists
- [x] Grounded aircraft shows a persistent red banner on its detail page and a distinct "GROUNDED" badge on the dashboard and aircraft list (overrides maintenance status colour)
- [x] Snag entry available standalone from the aircraft detail page and from the full snag list page
- [x] "Active Known Points" panel on the aircraft detail page listing all open snags
- [x] Closing a snag requires a brief resolution note; closed snags are archived, not deleted
- [x] Grounding snags surface in the dashboard's Alerts panel above scheduled triggers
- [x] Dev seed covers: one aircraft with a grounding snag, one with a non-grounding snag, one clean
- [x] Route tests: snag CRUD, grounding propagation to aircraft status, dashboard ordering

---

## Phase 13 — Fleet Maintenance Overview ✅

Goal: a single page giving a fleet-wide picture of all maintenance obligations and open
defects — the "morning briefing" view an operator or CAMO inspector would want.

**By-type view** (default tab / section):
- [x] Grounding snags section — all open grounding snags across all aircraft, red alert style; links to each aircraft's snag list
- [x] Open snags section — all non-grounding open snags fleet-wide; links to each aircraft's snag list
- [x] Maintenance timeline section — all triggers across all aircraft, full list (not capped); columns: aircraft, item, type, due date/hobbs, status badge; link to service form and per-aircraft maintenance list
- [x] Links to per-aircraft snag list and full maintenance history within each section
- [x] Sorting: snags by `reported_at` ascending (oldest on top); maintenance triggers by urgency band (overdue → due soon → OK), then by `due_date` ascending within each band; hours-based triggers (no reliable date) sorted after all calendar-dated triggers within their band

**Chronological view** (second tab / toggle):
- [x] Single unified list of alerts only (grounding snags, open snags, overdue and due-soon triggers), sorted by date ascending — oldest/most-overdue on top
- [x] Calendar-dated items sort by their due date; hours-based triggers (no reliable date) pushed to the end of the list
- [x] Each row labelled by type (Grounding / Snag / Maintenance) with appropriate badge colour
- [x] Same per-aircraft action links as the by-type view

**Common:**
- [x] "All clear" empty state when no open snags and no overdue/due-soon triggers
- [x] Route accessible from the "Maintenance" navbar link; view toggle uses btn-group for clear active/inactive visibility
- [x] Dev seed covers the full range of states so both views render non-trivially
- [x] Route tests: page renders with mixed fleet data, both views accessible

---

## Phase 14 — Email Infrastructure ✅

Goal: establish the full email-sending stack so that every later phase that needs
to send a message (welcome email, maintenance alert, reservation confirmation, …)
has a working, tested foundation to call into.

**Configuration (env vars, consistent with the rest of the app's infrastructure config):**
- [x] SMTP settings read from environment variables: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_USE_TLS` (default true), `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`
- [x] Configuration page gains an "Email" section showing which env vars are set (values masked; password shown as "Set"/"Not set" only) and their current status — read-only display, no form to edit (operators configure via their Docker Compose / `.env` file); unset vars show a "Not set" indicator, vars with a default show the default value labelled as such
- [x] "Send test email" button — sends a plain-text probe to the logged-in user's address and flashes success/failure with the SMTP error message if any

**Email service (`services/email_service.py`):**
- [x] `send_email(to, subject, text_body, html_body=None)` — reads SMTP settings from env, connects via `smtplib`, sends a `MIMEMultipart` message; raises `EmailNotConfiguredError` if `SMTP_HOST` is unset, `EmailSendError` on SMTP failure
- [x] Jinja2-based HTML email template (`templates/email/base_email.html`) — branded header, body slot, footer with unsubscribe note placeholder
- [x] Plain-text fallback always included (accessibility + spam-filter hygiene)
- [x] `EmailNotConfiguredError` and `EmailSendError` custom exceptions; callers catch and flash a user-friendly message rather than crashing

**Demo / dev:**
- [x] Demo mode disables outbound email entirely (guard in `send_email` checks `FLASK_ENV`)
- [x] Route tests: test-email endpoint (mocked SMTP via `unittest.mock`), `send_email` unit tests covering the not-configured and SMTP-error paths

**Inbound email (future):**
- Receiving email (invoices, AD/STC notifications forwarded by airworthiness bodies) would require either a self-hosted MTA (Postfix + procmail) or a webhook from a transactional mail provider (Mailgun, SendGrid inbound parse). Tracked in [`docs/backlog.md`](backlog.md); the architecture decision (self-hosted vs. provider webhook) should be made when the use-cases are better defined.

---

## Phase 15 — Counter Renaming & Maintenance Fix ✅

Goal: correct the maintenance hour source (currently using flight time instead of
engine time) and lay the DB foundation for the full logbook refinement.
No visible UI changes beyond the aircraft settings page.
Documented in [`docs/logbook_airplane.md`](logbook_airplane.md).

**`FlightEntry` column renames:**
- [x] Rename `hobbs_start` / `hobbs_end` → `flight_time_counter_start` / `flight_time_counter_end`
- [x] Rename `tach_start` / `tach_end` → `engine_time_counter_start` / `engine_time_counter_end`
- [x] Rename photo fields: `hobbs_photo` → `flight_counter_photo`, `tach_photo` → `engine_counter_photo`

**`Aircraft` model — fix maintenance hour source:**
- [x] `Aircraft.total_hobbs` property renamed to `total_engine_hours` — now reads from `engine_time_counter_end` (tach/engine time, which is the correct basis for maintenance scheduling); previously incorrectly used the flight time counter
- [x] Add `Aircraft.total_flight_hours` property — reads from `flight_time_counter_end` (for display and pilot logbook use)
- [x] `MaintenanceTrigger.due_hobbs` column renamed to `due_engine_hours`; `status()` method updated accordingly

**Aircraft-level logbook settings (new fields on `Aircraft`):**
- [x] `regime` — `EASA | FAA` (default `EASA`); controls which logbook fields are required vs optional
- [x] `has_flight_counter` — bool (default `True`); whether the aircraft has a separate airspeed-activated flight time counter
- [x] `flight_counter_offset` — Numeric(3,1) (default `0.3`); tenths of an hour subtracted from engine time to derive flight time on tach-only aircraft
- [x] Aircraft settings UI updated to expose these three fields with inline help text (see [`docs/logbook_airplane.md`](logbook_airplane.md))

**Migration:**
- [x] Alembic migration: rename `hobbs`/`tach` columns, rename `due_hobbs`, add three new `Aircraft` columns

**Dev seed:**
- [x] Seed flight entries updated with renamed counter fields
- [x] At least one seed aircraft configured as tach-only (`has_flight_counter = False`)

**Tests:**
- [x] Maintenance hour source: `total_engine_hours` uses engine counter; `total_flight_hours` uses flight counter; trigger `status()` uses engine hours
- [x] Aircraft settings: `regime`, `has_flight_counter`, `flight_counter_offset` persist correctly
- [x] Existing flight list and logbook views still render after column renames

---

## Phase 16 — FlightCrew, EASA Fields & Logbook UI ✅

Goal: complete the EASA AMC1 ORO.MLR.110-compliant journey log — crew model,
full set of per-flight fields, revised entry form, and updated logbook view.

**New `FlightCrew` model:**
- [x] `id` PK, `flight_id` FK → `FlightEntry` (cascade delete), `user_id` FK → `User` (nullable — null for external/visiting pilots), `name` String (always stored), `role` String (`PIC | IP | SP | COPILOT`), `sort_order` Integer
- [x] Up to 2 crew members per flight entry; enforced in the form, not at DB level
- [x] `user_id` link enables Phase 17 pilot logbook to query "all flights I was crew on"
- [x] Remove `pilot` String field from `FlightEntry`; migrate existing values to a `FlightCrew` record with `role = PIC`

**New `FlightEntry` fields:**
- [x] `departure_time` — Time, UTC, nullable (EASA col 7)
- [x] `arrival_time` — Time, UTC, nullable (EASA col 8)
- [x] `flight_time` — Numeric(4,1), nullable; auto-derived from counter difference or `engine_time − flight_counter_offset` (tach-only); manually overridable
- [x] `nature_of_flight` — String(100), nullable; free text with pre-seeded suggestions (Local / Navigation / Training / IFR / Night / Ferry / Other)
- [x] `passenger_count` — Integer, nullable
- [x] `landing_count` — Integer, nullable

**Counter pre-fill logic:**
- [x] On new flight entry, `engine_time_counter_start` and `flight_time_counter_start` pre-filled from the previous entry's end values
- [x] First entry for an aircraft: start values left blank (user enters manually)
- [x] If a start value ever differs from the previous entry's end value, show a discrepancy warning

**UI:**
- [x] Revised flight entry form with all fields grouped logically: Date / Crew / Route / Times / Counters / Nature & Passengers / Notes / Photos / Fuel
- [x] Nature of flight — `<input list>` with `<datalist>`: pre-seeded suggestions + previously used free-text values for that aircraft
- [x] Times displayed and entered in UTC with a clear label
- [x] For tach-only aircraft (`has_flight_counter = False`): flight counter fields hidden; `flight_time` auto-computed from `engine_time − flight_counter_offset`
- [x] Logbook view updated to display columns matching the EASA journey log layout

**Migration:**
- [x] No Alembic (project uses `create_all`); demo mode drop/recreate handles schema changes

**Documentation:**
- [x] [`docs/logbook_airplane.md`](logbook_airplane.md) updated to reflect final field names and implementation decisions

**Dev seed:**
- [x] Crew records created for existing seed entries (solo PIC; C172 cross-country has a second COPILOT crew member)
- [x] `nature_of_flight`, departure/arrival times, and landing counts added to seed entries

**Tests:**
- [x] `FlightCrew` model: cascade delete, nullable `user_id`, `sort_order`
- [x] Counter pre-fill: start values populated from previous entry; blank on first entry
- [x] Flight time derivation: from counter difference; from `engine − offset` (tach-only); manual override wins
- [x] Nature of flight: free-text value stored; returned in suggestions on subsequent entries for same aircraft
- [x] View tests: revised form renders all new fields; new fields saved correctly; two crew members

---

## Phase 17 — Pilot Profile & Manual Logbook ✅

Goal: give each pilot their own EASA-compliant personal logbook that works as
a standalone manual tool — entries can be created and maintained entirely by
hand, including flights on aircraft not managed in OpenHangar.
Documented in [`docs/logbook_pilot.md`](logbook_pilot.md).

**`PilotProfile` model:**
- [x] `user_id` FK → `User` (1:1), `license_number` String nullable, `medical_expiry` Date nullable, `sep_expiry` Date nullable
- [x] Pilot profile page — view and edit own profile from the user menu

**`PilotLogbookEntry` model:**
- [x] Core fields: `pilot_user_id` FK → `User`, `date`, `aircraft_type` / `aircraft_registration` (text; always free text at this phase)
- [x] `flight_id` FK → `FlightEntry`, nullable; `SET NULL` on `FlightEntry` deletion so the pilot's record is preserved
- [x] Route fields: `departure_place` / `departure_time` (UTC), `arrival_place` / `arrival_time` (UTC)
- [x] `pic_name` — String, free text
- [x] Operational conditions: `night_time`, `instrument_time` — Numeric(4,1) hours
- [x] Landings: `landings_day`, `landings_night` — Integer counts
- [x] Time columns: `single_pilot_se`, `single_pilot_me`, `multi_pilot` — Numeric(4,1) hours
- [x] `total_flight_time` — Numeric(4,1), derived: `single_pilot_se + single_pilot_me + multi_pilot`
- [x] Function columns: `function_pic`, `function_copilot`, `function_dual`, `function_instructor` — Numeric(4,1) hours
- [x] `remarks` — Text, nullable

**Manual entry form:**
- [x] Standalone entry form — all fields manually entered; aircraft registration and type are free text
- [x] Accessible from the pilot's logbook view ("Add entry" button)

**Pilot logbook view:**
- [x] Chronological list of all `PilotLogbookEntry` records for the logged-in pilot
- [x] Running totals row (dynamically computed): Night, Instruments, Day landings, Night landings, S/E, M/E, Multi-pilot, Total flight time, PIC, Co-pilot, Dual, Instructor
- [x] Logbook is private to the holder — no other user (including admins) can view it; opt-in sharing is tracked in [`docs/backlog.md`](backlog.md)

**Dev seed:**
- [x] Pilot profiles for seed users
- [x] At least 2 standalone entries per seed pilot

**Tests:**
- [x] `PilotLogbookEntry` model: `SET NULL` on `FlightEntry` deletion, running totals computation
- [x] Manual entry: create, edit, delete; all fields persist correctly
- [x] Route tests: logbook list and totals row, add/edit/delete entry

---

## Phase 18 — Pilot Currency & Legality Checks ✅

Goal: derive currency status, medical validity, and legality checks from pilot
logbook data and surface warnings on the dashboard.

**Currency calculations:**
- [x] Passenger currency — count take-offs and landings in rolling 90-day window; warn when < 3
- [x] Night currency — count night take-offs and landings in rolling 90-day window; warn when < 3
- [x] Medical expiry — warn on dashboard when < 90 days remaining
- [x] SEP endorsement expiry — warn on dashboard when < 90 days remaining

**Forward-looking legality checks:**
- [x] "Approaching currency gap" warning: show the date by which the pilot must fly again to keep passenger/night currency, and the current shortfall
- [x] Dashboard panel: currency summary card for the logged-in pilot (medical, SEP, passenger currency, night currency) — colour-coded green/yellow/red

**Dev seed:**
- [x] At least one seed pilot with medical expiry < 90 days
- [x] At least one pilot approaching passenger currency lapse (last 3 qualifying flights > 60 days ago)

**Tests:**
- [x] Passenger and night currency: rolling 90-day window, boundary conditions (exactly 3, fewer than 3)
- [x] Medical/SEP expiry: warning injected at < 90 days; no warning at ≥ 90 days
- [x] Forward-looking gap: correct deadline date and shortfall count
- [x] Dashboard warning injection

---

## Phase 19 — Internationalisation (i18n) Infrastructure ✅

Goal: set up Flask-Babel, user language preference, locale selector, locale-aware
date formatting, and language switcher. Full string wrapping and French translation
are deferred to Phase 19b.

**Flask-Babel setup:**
- [x] Add `Flask-Babel` dependency (`flask-babel>=4.0.0`)
- [x] `babel.cfg` extraction config covering `[python: **.py]` and `[jinja2: **/templates/**.html]`
- [x] `pybabel extract` → `app/translations/messages.pot` committed to repo (8 navbar strings wrapped as proof of concept)
- [x] Navbar strings wrapped in `_()` as proof of concept; full wrap deferred to Phase 19b
- [x] English (`en`) as source language and automatic fallback for any untranslated string

**User language preference:**
- [x] `User` model gains a `language` VARCHAR(8) column (BCP 47 tag, e.g. `en`, `fr`); default `en`
- [x] Flask-Babel locale selector reads `user.language` when authenticated; falls back to `Accept-Language` header
- [x] Language switcher in the navbar — EN/FR buttons; selecting one saves the preference to `User.language` in the DB
- [x] Preference persists across requests (stored in DB)

**Locale-aware formatting:**
- [x] Dates rendered via Flask-Babel `format_date()` in pilot logbook — respects locale (e.g. "mai" in French)
- [x] `format_date`, `format_datetime`, `format_decimal` injected into Jinja globals
- [x] `<html lang="...">` attribute reflects active locale

**Dev seed:**
- [x] Second dev user `pierre@openhangar.dev` with `language = 'fr'`

**Tests:**
- [x] Language switcher: GET `/set-language/fr` updates `User.language` in DB
- [x] Locale selector: authenticated user with `language='fr'` sees French month names in logbook
- [x] Unauthenticated request with `Accept-Language: fr` gets `lang="fr"` in HTML
- [x] Date formatting: English → "May", French → "mai" in logbook dates
- [x] HTML `lang` attribute matches user locale

**Phase 19b — Full String Coverage & French Translation ✅**
- [x] Wrap all remaining user-facing strings in `_()` across all templates and routes
- [x] `translations/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po` — complete French translation (581 strings)
- [x] `.mo` files compiled and committed
- [x] Language selector with flags and dropdown instead of buttons
- [x] Weblate setup documentation (`docs/dev-i18n.md`)
- [x] GitHub Actions for `.pot` sync and `.mo` compilation (added to `ci.yml`)
- [x] `pybabel compile` added to Dockerfile
- [x] Translation completeness test (`polib`) — `TestTranslationCompleteness` in `test_i18n.py`

---

## Phase 20 — Mass & Balance ✅

Goal: allow owners to define the weight & balance envelope for each aircraft
and compute the loaded CG for a given flight, flagging any out-of-envelope condition.

**Aircraft W&B configuration:**
- [x] `WeightBalanceConfig` model — aircraft FK, empty weight (kg), empty CG arm (m from datum), max take-off weight, forward CG limit, aft CG limit, fuel unit (L/gal); optional per-aircraft datum note
- [x] `WeightBalanceStation` model — config FK, label, arm (m), max weight kg (non-fuel stations), capacity L or gal (fuel stations), is_fuel flag
- [x] CRUD UI on the aircraft detail page — add/edit/delete stations; edit envelope limits and fuel unit (`/wb/config`); station limit label updates dynamically (kg ↔ L/gal) based on fuel checkbox
- [x] Dev seed: realistic W&B config for OO-PNH (C172S, Avgas, 262.5 L capacity) and OO-GRN (Robin DR-401, Jet-A1, 160 L capacity)

**In-flight CG calculation:**
- [x] W&B entry form: fuel stations use volume inputs (L or gal) with `step=0.25` and `max=capacity`; non-fuel stations use weight inputs (kg); fuel entry shows "≈ X kg" equivalent live
- [x] `GAL_TO_L = 3.78541` conversion; CG route converts volume → kg using `volume × FUEL_DENSITY[fuel_type] × (GAL_TO_L if gal else 1)`
- [x] Server-side capacity validation: volume > capacity triggers a validation error
- [x] `station_weights` JSON stores volume (L/gal) for fuel stations and kg for non-fuel stations
- [x] Real-time CG computation (client-side JS): total weight, moment sum → loaded CG; green OK / red OUT overlay
- [x] W&B calculation list page — date, label, total weight, loaded CG, in-envelope badge; edit and delete actions
- [x] Aircraft detail page shows the last computed CG and whether it was in-envelope
- [x] Optional ability to link a FlightEntry with a W&B entry

**Envelope diagram:**
- [x] Canvas envelope chart (client-side JS): forward/aft CG limits and MTOW plotted as a green polygon; loaded point overlaid in green (in envelope) or red (out of envelope)

**Tests:**
- [x] CG calculation: given known station weights/volumes → correct total weight and CG moment
- [x] Envelope check: point inside envelope → OK; aft of limit → out-of-envelope
- [x] CRUD: add/edit stations and config limits — all persist correctly; fuel station stores capacity, non-fuel stores max_weight
- [x] Flight link: W&B entry links to FlightEntry; link set to NULL when flight is deleted
- [x] Fuel volume → kg: 100 L avgas = 72 kg in total weight; 10 gal × GAL_TO_L × 0.72 verified
- [x] Capacity validation: volume > capacity shows error; negative volume shows error

---

## ✅ Phase 21 — Multi-user

Goal: support more than one user per tenant, with role-based access control enforced server-side on every route.

**Roles:**
- [x] Three additional roles alongside Owner: **Pilot/Renter** (can log flights and view all records; cannot edit aircraft configuration or manage costs), **Maintenance** (can view and update maintenance logs; cannot log flights or edit aircraft data), **Viewer** (read-only access across the tenant)
- [x] Role enforcement on all aircraft, maintenance, flight, expense, and document routes

**Invitation flow:**
- [x] `UserInvitation` model — token (UUID), tenant FK, target role, expires_at, accepted_at
- [x] User management UI — admin invites a user via a time-limited URL (always shown in the UI, also sent by email if SMTP is configured); admin can reassign roles and revoke access
- [x] Accept-invitation route — renders a password-setup form; on submit creates `TenantUser` and marks invitation accepted

**Profile:**
- [x] User profile page — change password, manage TOTP (verify it works for all roles, not just Owner)

**Dev seed:**
- [x] Extend dev seed with two additional users: one Pilot/Renter and one Maintenance user to exercise role-based access

**Demo environment:**
- [x] Each demo slot seeds two users into the same tenant: one Owner and one Pilot/Renter, so both perspectives share the same fleet and data
- [x] Landing page shows two "Try the Demo" buttons side by side: **Try as Owner** and **Try as Renter**; each enters the demo slot under the corresponding user account
- [x] The existing single demo entry point (`/demo/enter`) is extended with a `role=` parameter (`owner` or `renter`); the landing page buttons pass this parameter

**Tests:**
- [x] Invitation: creation, expiry enforcement, acceptance, duplicate-acceptance rejection
- [x] Role enforcement: representative routes checked for each role — allowed actions succeed, forbidden actions return 403
- [x] Demo entry: entering as owner lands on the owner account; entering as renter lands on the renter account of the same tenant; renter cannot access owner-only routes

---

## Phase 22 — Reservations & Rentals ✅

Goal: allow an owner to manage aircraft bookings for pilot/renters, with conflict detection and cost estimation.

- [x] `Reservation` model — aircraft FK, pilot FK, start/end datetime, status (pending / confirmed / cancelled), notes
- [x] Booking calendar view per aircraft — month/week grid, colour-coded by status
- [x] Create / edit / cancel reservation from the calendar or aircraft detail page
- [x] Per-aircraft minimum and maximum booking duration (stored in DB, editable by owner)
- [x] Owner approval workflow — reservation starts as "pending", owner confirms or declines
- [x] Cost estimation at booking time based on current hourly rate (defined at the aircraft level; will be derived from Expense data in a later phase)
- [x] Conflict detection — prevent overlapping confirmed reservations
- [x] Dev seed: two weeks of reservations across all seed aircraft

**Tests:**
- [x] CRUD: create, edit, cancel reservation — all persist correctly
- [x] Conflict detection: overlapping confirmed reservations rejected
- [x] Approval flow: pending → confirmed / declined by owner
- [x] Calendar rendering: reservations appear in the correct slots

---

## Phase 23 — Granular Roles & Per-Aircraft Access Control ✅

Goal: replace the flat five-role model with a richer profile-type + permission-mask system that supports fine-grained per-aircraft grants, an "access to all aircraft" flag (including aircraft added in the future), and the groundwork for student and instructor profiles (full flows in Phase 26). A central `AuthorizationService` replaces ad-hoc role checks scattered across blueprints.

**Profile model:**
- [x] `is_pilot` boolean on user — enables pilot-specific flows: personal logbook, reservations, pilot-level flight logging
- [x] `is_maintenance` boolean — enables maintenance-specific flows: edit aircraft details/components, add/edit maintenance tasks
- [x] `view_only` boolean — suppresses all write capabilities regardless of other flags; supersedes `is_pilot` / `is_maintenance` when true
- [x] Student and instructor profile types: data model only (added `STUDENT` and `INSTRUCTOR` to `Role` enum); full permission flows and UI deferred to Phase 26
- ~~Add `profile_type` column replacing the current `Role` enum~~ — design changed; `Role` enum was extended with STUDENT/INSTRUCTOR instead

**Aircraft access model:**
- [x] `permissions_mask` bitmask on `UserAircraftAccess`; `PermissionBit` constants class with all eight bits and per-role defaults
- [x] All-aircraft grant: `UserAllAircraftAccess(user_id, tenant_id)` model grants access to every existing and future aircraft in a tenant
- [x] Admin users implicitly bypass all access checks (admin bypass is step 1 in the evaluation order)
- [x] `permissions_mask` bits: `view_aircraft`, `edit_aircraft`, `read_maintenance_full`, `read_maintenance_limited`, `write_maintenance`, `edit_components`, `write_logbook`, `reserve_aircraft`
- [x] Dev seed: `is_pilot`/`is_maintenance` flags set; all-planes row added for admin user
- ~~Migrate existing per-aircraft access rows to an explicit mask~~ — N/A; `permissions_mask` is nullable and falls back to role defaults by design

**Authorization service:**
- [x] Central `AuthorizationService` in `app/services/authorization.py` — `effective_mask()`, `can()`, `maintenance_view_level()`
- [x] Evaluation order: (1) admin bypass → (2) all_planes row → (3) per-aircraft row → (4) profile-type defaults; `view_only` strips write bits at the end
- [x] Role presets in `PermissionBit.ROLE_DEFAULTS` — explicit masks override defaults in both directions
- ~~Replace remaining ad-hoc `require_role()` calls with `AuthorizationService.can()`~~ — deferred; low urgency refactor, 50 call sites

**Enforcement rules:**
- [x] `view_maintenance`: `maintenance_view_level()` returns `full` / `limited` / `none`; limited view shows only overdue/due-soon items, hides interval and service-history columns
- [x] `log_flight` on a managed aircraft: `require_pilot_access` guard applied; covers INSTRUCTOR role and `is_pilot` flag
- ~~`log_flight` on an external aircraft: pilot logbook entry only~~ — already handled by architecture; `PilotLogbookEntry` and `FlightEntry` are separate models
- ~~`reserve_aircraft`: enforce `reserve_aircraft` bit; students denied~~ — deferred to Phase 26 (student/instructor flows)

**Frontend:**
- [x] User management UI: `is_pilot` / `is_maintenance` / `view_only` toggles per user (auto-submit checkboxes)
- [x] Per-aircraft permission editor: checkbox grid with per-bit columns; quick-preset buttons (`/config/users/<id>/permissions`)
- [x] "Grant access to all aircraft" toggle (`UserAllAircraftAccess`)
- [x] Maintenance view: limited view banner + hidden columns for pilots/students
- ~~Reservation UI: show booking controls only when user holds `reserve_aircraft` bit~~ — deferred to Phase 26

**Tests:**
- [x] Permission evaluation: `effective_mask` and `can()` for each role and access pattern; `view_only` strips write bits
- [x] all_planes: pilot with `UserAllAircraftAccess` sees full fleet in aircraft list
- [x] Limited DTO: pilot gets limited view (overdue/due-soon only), owner gets full view
- [x] Override: custom `permissions_mask` on per-aircraft row takes effect

---

## Phase 24 — CI & Code-Quality Hardening ✅

Goal: lock in the quality gains already made and close the remaining gaps in linting, security scanning, supply-chain hygiene, and pipeline strictness — chipping away one item at a time.

**Code quality**
- [x] Add **Ruff** to CI (linting + import sorting) and fail the build on violations; add ruff to pre-commit
- [x] Add **Ruff formatter** check to CI so formatting divergence blocks merges
- [x] Add **mypy** type-checking step to CI (start in lenient/non-strict mode and ratchet) ✅
- [x] **mypy strict mode** — ratchet complete: `strict = true` in `pyproject.toml`; all 39 source files pass with zero errors ✅
- [x] Add **bandit** Python security linter to CI; fail on HIGH severity findings ✅
- [x] Add local pre-push checks for ruff and bandit via `.githooks/pre-push`; hadolint stays CI-only (too slow/heavy for a local hook) ✅

**Docker hardening**
- [x] Add **hadolint** Dockerfile linting step to CI
- [x] Refactor `docker/Dockerfile` into a **multi-stage build** (build stage for compile-time deps, lean runtime stage) to shrink the final image and reduce Trivy surface
- [x] Flip Trivy **`exit-code`** from `'0'` to `'1'` so HIGH/CRITICAL unfixed vulns block CI

**Supply chain / dependency hygiene**
- [x] Add **`.github/dependabot.yml`** for automated pip and GitHub Actions version-update PRs
- [x] Add **SBOM generation** (Syft / CycloneDX) to the Docker job and attach the SBOM to each release artifact

**Process / governance**
- [x] Enforce **coverage threshold** (`--cov-fail-under=100`) in `pytest.ini` so a coverage regression blocks CI ✅
- [x] Make the **translation check hard-fail** (exit non-zero) instead of emitting a warning and continuing, docs: document pre-push translation hook in development.md
- [x] Add a **`CODEOWNERS`** file mapping sensitive paths (routes, auth, migrations) to required reviewers ✅

---

## Phase 25 — Production Readiness (v1)

Goal: close the gaps that prevent a safe first production deployment for a single-operator
self-hosted instance. No new features — only hardening, correctness, and operational confidence.

**Database schema migrations (Alembic):**
- [x] Initialise Alembic with a baseline revision that matches the current schema exactly
- [x] Wire `alembic upgrade head` into the Docker entrypoint so every container restart applies pending migrations automatically
- [x] Add a CI step that applies all migrations against a fresh PostgreSQL DB and runs the test suite on top, confirming the migrated schema is equivalent to `create_all`
- [x] Document the migration workflow in `docs/development.md` (how to generate a new revision, how to test it locally, what happens on first deploy vs. upgrade)

**Backup & restore verification:**
- [x] Run a full end-to-end restore drill: take a backup ZIP from a running instance, restore it to a clean DB, and confirm all data (flights, documents, maintenance records) is intact
- [x] Fix any gaps found; update `docs/backup_restore.md` with exact commands and expected output (fixed critical bug: restore docs used `hashlib.sha256` but backup uses HKDF-SHA256; added regression tests in `test_backup.py`; add `postgresql-client` to Dockerfile so `pg_dump` is available)
- [x] Add a CI smoke-test that produces a backup against a real PostgreSQL DB using `flask backup-now`, asserts "Backup OK:" in output, confirming `pg_dump` runs end-to-end

**Documentation review**
- [x] Review all user-focused documentation to ensure completeness/correctness (fixed stale `db.create_all()` reference in `docs/self-hosting.md` → Alembic; all other docs verified accurate)
- [x] gap (Phase 16): `docs/logbook_airplane.md` already reflects the final column names (`flight_time_counter_*`, `engine_time_counter_*`) and the `regime` / `has_flight_counter` / `flight_counter_offset` aircraft settings — no changes needed

**Rate limiting & brute-force protection:**
- [x] Decided approach: Traefik `RateLimit` middleware applied at the reverse-proxy level on `/login` — no application code changes required
- [x] Added Traefik labels to `docker/docker-compose.yml` (5 req/min steady, burst 10, per source IP) and documented the snippet with a nginx note in `docs/self-hosting.md`
- [x] Added brute-force section to `SECURITY.md` explaining the infrastructure-layer approach and linking to the self-hosting guide

## ✅ Phase 26 — Onboarding Wizard & Adaptive UI

Goal: deliver a "wow" first-run experience for a fresh self-hosted install —
a focused, friendly setup flow that gets the instance ready in minutes and
lands the user on a dashboard already tailored to their context. Every choice
made here is reversible and clearly labelled as such, so operators feel free
to answer quickly rather than agonising over the perfect answer.

**UX principles for the wizard:**
- Each screen asks at most one or two things; no long forms
- Every question carries a one-line reassurance: *"You can change this later in Settings"*
- Tone is warm and personal throughout ("Let's get your hangar set up")
- Progress indicator shows which step the user is on and how many remain
- The wizard is **not accessible in demo mode** (`FLASK_ENV=demo` → redirect to home)

**Instance bootstrap — first visit to an empty database (step 1):**
- [x] Detect empty database (no users exist) and redirect any request to `/setup`; in demo mode `/setup` redirects to the demo home instead
- [x] Setup screen collects: full name, email address, password (with confirmation), optional TOTP enrollment (QR code + verification token before proceeding)
- [x] Submitting creates the `Tenant`, the first `User`, and a `TenantUser` record with the Owner role in a single transaction
- [x] `/setup` redirects to `/config/` (or to `/login` if not authenticated) once a user exists

**Operating-context questionnaire (steps 2–3 — immediately after account creation):**
- [x] **Primary-use question (step 2):** two large, friendly cards — *"I manage aircraft"* (track flights, maintenance, documents, costs) and *"Pilot logbook only"* (keep a personal flight record); labelled *"You can always expand this later in Settings"*
  - *Pilot logbook only* → `operating_model = sole_pilot`; wizard ends here and goes straight to the dashboard — no aircraft count question, no operating model detail; aircraft and maintenance modules hidden from navbar but accessible if they revisit Settings
  - *I manage aircraft* → continue to step 3

- [x] **Aircraft management detail (step 3, manage-aircraft path only):**
  - *How many aircraft do you plan to manage?* — numeric input (1 or more); labelled *"You can add more any time"*; drives adaptive UI (1 = single-aircraft simplifications, >1 = full fleet view)
  - *How would you describe your operation?* — clearly-worded cards: **Sole operator** / **Shared ownership** / **Flight club** / **Flight school**; labelled *"You can update this in Settings"*
  - *Flight club* selected → inline follow-up: *What is your club called?* (stored in `TenantProfile.club_name`; used by Phase 29)
  - *Flight school* selected → inline follow-up: *What is your school called?* (stored in `TenantProfile.school_name`; reserved for a future phase)
  - *Shared ownership* selected → inline follow-up: invite co-owners (see multi-invite below); labelled *"You can invite more people later"*
  - *Renting or lending to others?* — Yes / No toggle; labelled *"You can change this any time"*

- [x] All answers stored in `TenantProfile` immediately — later phases build on these values rather than asking again

**Multi-user invite (upgrade to existing `UserInvitation` flow):**
- [x] Extend `UserInvitation` with a `display_name` field (the name entered by the person doing the inviting; used to greet the invitee on the claim page)
- [x] Replace the existing single-invite form with a dynamic multi-row form: each row collects name and role (Admin / Owner); rows can be added or removed before submitting; one `UserInvitation` record and token is created per row in a single submission
- [x] This multi-invite form is available standalone from the Configuration / user management page, not only from the wizard
- [x] Generated invite URLs are shown in a summary after submission for the inviter to copy and send; each URL encodes only the token
- [x] When an invitee visits their URL they are greeted by name ("Welcome, Sophie!"), then complete account creation: email, password, optional TOTP — the name is pre-filled and editable
- [x] Tokens remain single-use and expire after 7 days; expired or already-claimed tokens redirect to login with an explanatory message
- [x] The wizard's shared-ownership co-owner step renders this same multi-invite form inline, pre-labelled for the shared-ownership context

**Tenant profile model (foundation for future phases):**
- [x] `TenantProfile` model (or JSON column on `Tenant`) with fields: `operating_model` (enum: **sole_pilot** / sole_operator / shared_ownership / flight_club / flight_school), `planned_aircraft_count` (integer; null for sole_pilot), `allows_rental` (bool), `club_name` (string; flight_club), `school_name` (string; flight_school), `organisation_name` (string; shared_ownership, used by Phase 28)
- [x] `UserInvitation` extended with `display_name` (the name entered by the first owner during the wizard) so the claim page can greet the invitee by name
- [x] Configuration page exposes the full profile for review and editing after initial setup

**Adaptive UI based on profile:**
- [x] *Sole pilot* (`operating_model = sole_pilot`): aircraft, maintenance, and expense modules hidden from navbar; dashboard shows pilot logbook summary and a gentle prompt — *"Want to track an aircraft too? Add one in Settings"*
- [x] *Single aircraft* (`planned_aircraft_count = 1`): suppress fleet-count card on dashboard; "Add aircraft" quick-action disappears from dashboard once one aircraft exists (still accessible from `/aircraft/`); dashboard links directly to that aircraft's detail page
- [x] *Multi-aircraft* (`planned_aircraft_count > 1`): "Add aircraft" quick-action stays on dashboard until the planned count is reached, then moves to `/aircraft/` only
- [x] *No-rental profile*: Reservations module hidden from navbar (Phase 22; surfaced only when `allows_rental = true`)
- [x] *Sole operator, single aircraft*: offer a quick-log widget directly on the dashboard

**Tests:**
- [x] `/setup` accessible on empty DB; redirects to `/config/` (or `/login`) once a user exists; redirects to demo home in demo mode
- [x] Transaction atomicity: partial failures during bootstrap leave DB unchanged
- [x] TOTP step optional; when completed the secret is stored and immediately active
- [x] `TenantProfile` persists all answers correctly for every operating model combination
- [x] Dashboard quick-action visibility follows `planned_aircraft_count` and actual aircraft count correctly
- [x] Multi-invite: submitting N rows creates N `UserInvitation` records atomically; each token is single-use; claiming a token creates the user, pre-fills the display name, and marks the token consumed; expired tokens show an explanatory message
- [x] Multi-invite form works identically from the Configuration page and from within the wizard

---

## ✅ Phase 27 — Document Improvements

Goal: make documents a first-class feature — attach files to pilot profiles and insurance records, improve the upload experience with live title suggestions, and let users view PDFs and images inline instead of always downloading.

**Pilot profile documents:**
- [x] Pilot profile page gains a "Documents" section: upload and manage files typed as **License** (pilot certificate scan) or **Medical certificate** (class 1/2/LAPL scan)
- [x] Each document stores: file, title (free text with suggestions — see below), document type, `valid_until` date (optional), and the existing sensitive flag
- [x] Expiry warning: if `valid_until` is set and within 90 days, show a badge on the pilot profile page and surface the alert on the pilot's dashboard currency card

**Aircraft insurance certificate:**
- [x] Insurance section on the aircraft detail page gains an "Attach certificate" upload button
- [x] The uploaded file is stored as a `Document` linked to the aircraft with type `insurance_certificate`; it is automatically associated with the aircraft's current `insurance_expiry` date
- [x] Only one active certificate per aircraft; uploading a new one marks the previous as superseded (file kept in storage)
- [x] Certificate displayed inline in the Insurance section using the viewer below

**"As you type" title suggestions:**
- [x] Document upload title field shows a suggestion dropdown on focus; filters as the user types; field remains free text and accepts any value
- [x] Suggestions come from existing `Document` titles for the same tenant and `owner_type` (aircraft / pilot / component), delivered by a lightweight `/documents/title-suggestions?q=…&owner_type=…` endpoint (JSON list, up to 10 results, case-insensitive prefix match)

**Inline document viewer:**
- [x] Document list items open an inline viewer on click:
  - **PDF**: `<iframe>` or PDF.js modal; "Download" button below the viewer
  - **Images** (JPEG, PNG, WEBP): `<img>` in a modal; "Download" button below
  - **Word / Excel / other**: no viewer — clicking triggers a direct download
- [x] Viewer available from all document lists: aircraft documents, pilot profile documents, component documents

**"Download all documents" button:**
- [x] Aircraft detail Documents section gains a **Download all documents** button; the server builds a ZIP archive containing all visible documents for that aircraft (non-sensitive only for pilots/viewers; all for owners/admins) and serves it as `aircraft-<reg>-documents.zip`
- [x] ZIP includes a `manifest.txt` listing each file's title, document type, upload date, and filename

**Dev seed:**
- [x] Seed pilot profiles with one License and one Medical certificate document (PDF placeholder files bundled under `dev_seed_docs/`)
- [x] Seed OO-PNH with an insurance certificate document linked to its insurance expiry date
- [x] Clean up all dev seed documents (more PDF or images instead of .txt files)

**Tests:**
- [x] Pilot profile documents: License and Medical types save with correct `owner_type`; visible only to the holder and admins
- [x] Insurance certificate: upload links correctly to the aircraft's insurance expiry; previous certificate marked superseded; new upload replaces it in the Insurance section display
- [x] Title suggestions: returns prefix-matched results; empty query returns up to 10 most-recent titles; results scoped to tenant and `owner_type`
- [x] Inline viewer: PDF and image MIME types return the modal/iframe response; unsupported types trigger a direct download
- [x] Download-all ZIP: role-appropriate files included; sensitive documents excluded for pilots/viewers; `manifest.txt` present with correct entries

---

## Phase 28 — Pilot Logbook Import ✅

Goal: allow a pilot to bulk-import their existing logbook from a CSV or Excel file, with an interactive column-mapping step that is remembered for future re-imports from the same source format.

The reference format studied during design is a standard EASA-layout Excel logbook with the following structure:
- **Row 1**: Merged group headers (`DEPARTURE & ARRIVAL`, `LANDINGS`, `AIRCRAFT CATEGORY`, `OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS`, `PILOT FUNCTION`, `PAGE SUBTOTALS`) — not the real column names
- **Row 2**: Actual column headers: `DATE dd/mm/yy`, `AIRCRAFT TYPE`, `AIRCRAFT registration number`, `FROM`, `TIME` (×2 — departure and arrival, same name), `TO`, `PIC NAME`, `NO. ISTR. APPR.`, `DAY`, `NIGHT` (landings), `SE`, `ME`, `CROSS-COUNTRY`, `DAY`, `NIGHT` (operational), `PIC`, `CO-PIC`, `DUAL RECEIVED`, `TOTAL FLIGHT TIME`; plus page-subtotal columns
- **Row 3+**: Data rows, newest-first; some rows are page-subtotal accumulators (cells contain `timedelta` objects rather than `time` — must be skipped)
- Duration cells are `datetime.time` objects (e.g. 42 min = `time(0,42)`); time-of-day cells are stored as `"HH:MM"` strings

**Import model:**
- [x] `LogbookImportMapping` model — pilot user FK, a JSON blob storing the mapping between source column names (with position index to disambiguate duplicate names such as two `TIME` columns) and `PilotLogbookEntry` fields, a `source_fingerprint` (hash of the normalised header row) so the same format is recognised on re-upload; created_at timestamp
- [x] `LogbookImportBatch` model — pilot user FK, import timestamp, row count, skipped count, mapping FK; links to the created `PilotLogbookEntry` rows so an import can be reviewed or rolled back as a unit

**Upload & header detection:**
- [x] Accept CSV (any delimiter auto-detected via Python `csv.Sniffer`) and `.xlsx` / `.xls` files; reject other formats with a clear error
- [x] Auto-detect the header row: scan the first 20 rows; the header is the first row where ≥ 50 % of non-empty cells are non-numeric strings and the row has at least 4 non-empty cells — this skips rows 1 and merged-title rows while correctly identifying row 2 in the EASA Excel layout
- [x] Strip embedded newlines, leading/trailing whitespace, and normalise to lowercase for matching; append a positional suffix (`_2`, `_3`) to duplicate column names so that e.g. two `TIME` columns become `time` and `time_2`
- [x] Detect and mark subtotal rows before presenting the mapping: a row is flagged as a subtotal if the cell that maps to `date` contains a `timedelta` value, is empty, or contains text like "TOTAL" — subtotal rows are silently excluded from import and counted separately

**Column mapping UI:**
- [x] After upload, present a mapping page: one dropdown per source column, pre-filled by fuzzy-matching source names to `PilotLogbookEntry` fields (`date`, `aircraft_type`, `aircraft_registration`, `departure_place`, `departure_time`, `arrival_place`, `arrival_time`, `pic_name`, `night_time`, `instrument_time`, `landings_day`, `landings_night`, `single_pilot_se`, `single_pilot_me`, `multi_pilot`, `function_pic`, `function_copilot`, `function_dual`, `function_instructor`, `remarks`); unmapped columns default to *ignore*
- [x] Built-in alias table for common column names found in real logbooks: `FROM`→`departure_place`, `TO`→`arrival_place`, `TIME` (first)→`departure_time`, `TIME` (second)→`arrival_time`, `SE`→`single_pilot_se`, `ME`→`single_pilot_me`, `PIC`→`function_pic`, `CO-PIC`→`function_copilot`, `DUAL RECEIVED`→`function_dual`, `NIGHT` (under OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS)→`night_time`, `DAY` (under LANDINGS)→`landings_day`, `NIGHT` (under LANDINGS)→`landings_night`, `DATE dd/mm/yy`→`date`, `AIRCRAFT TYPE`→`aircraft_type`, `AIRCRAFT registration number`→`aircraft_registration`, `PIC NAME`→`pic_name`; columns with no mapping default to *ignore* (`NO. ISTR. APPR.`, `CROSS-COUNTRY`, subtotal columns)
- [x] If a `LogbookImportMapping` with a matching `source_fingerprint` already exists, pre-fill the mapping dropdowns from the saved mapping (with a notice "recognised from a previous import — please verify")
- [x] If no exact fingerprint match is found but the user has at least one previous `LogbookImportMapping`, compute column-overlap scores (case-insensitive, stripping whitespace) between the new file's normalised header and each saved mapping's stored column list; if the best-scoring mapping covers ≥ 60 % of the new file's columns, pre-fill from that mapping with a notice "No exact format match — closest previous mapping applied, please review"; if no saved mapping reaches the 60 % threshold, fall back to pure alias-based auto-mapping as if no prior mapping existed
- [x] Validate that at least `date` is mapped before allowing the user to proceed; show a preview of the first 5 data rows with the proposed mapping applied so the user can spot mis-mapped columns

**Opening-hours offset:**
- [x] Option on the mapping confirmation page: "I already had hours before this file starts" — the user enters cumulative totals for each time category (SE, ME, night, IFR, PIC, dual, instructor); these are saved as a single synthetic `PilotLogbookEntry` with `remarks = "Opening balance (imported)"` dated one day before the earliest imported entry
- [x] Alternatively the user may leave all offsets at zero if the file represents their complete history

**Import execution:**
- [x] Parse each data row using the confirmed mapping; skip rows where the mapped `date` cell cannot be parsed (count and report skipped rows) and subtotal rows (counted separately)
- [x] Date values: accept `datetime.datetime` objects from Excel, ISO strings, and common European formats (`dd/mm/yy`, `dd/mm/yyyy`)
- [x] Time-of-day values (`departure_time`, `arrival_time`): accept `"HH:MM"` strings and Python `time` objects from Excel
- [x] Duration fields (`night_time`, `function_pic`, etc.): accept Python `datetime.time` objects (Excel stores 42 min as `time(0,42)`), decimal hours (`1.5`), and `"HH:MM"` strings
- [x] Each successfully parsed row creates a `PilotLogbookEntry` with `flight_id = NULL` and `source = "import"`; the import source is stored so imported entries are distinguishable from manually-entered ones in the logbook view
- [x] On completion show a summary: rows imported, subtotal rows skipped, other rows skipped (with reason per row), opening-balance entry if applicable; save the mapping as a `LogbookImportMapping` for future re-use
- [x] Batch rollback: a "Delete this import" action on the import history page removes all entries belonging to that `LogbookImportBatch` in one operation

**Import history:**
- [x] Import history page (accessible from the pilot profile): lists past batches with date, row count, subtotals skipped, and source filename; allows rollback and re-download of the mapping as JSON

**Tests:**
- [x] Header auto-detection: header found at row 1 (simple CSV), row 2 (EASA Excel with group-header row), and not found (error)
- [x] Duplicate column disambiguation: two `TIME` columns → `time` and `time_2`, correctly mapped to departure and arrival
- [x] Subtotal row detection: rows with `timedelta` date cells are excluded and counted as subtotals, not errors
- [x] Built-in alias matching: `FROM`→`departure_place`, `SE`→`single_pilot_se`, `PIC`→`function_pic`, etc.
- [x] Mapping fingerprint: second upload with identical headers pre-fills from saved mapping (exact match)
- [x] Fuzzy fallback: upload with ≥ 60 % column overlap but different fingerprint → closest saved mapping proposed with "please review" notice; upload with < 60 % overlap → alias-only auto-mapping, no prior mapping proposed
- [x] Opening-balance entry: created one day before earliest row; totals match user input
- [x] Duration parsing: `datetime.time(0, 42)` → 0.7 h decimal; `"1:24"` → 1.4 h; `"1.5"` → 1.5 h
- [x] Skipped-row reporting: rows with unparseable dates counted separately from subtotal rows
- [x] Rollback: all entries in a batch deleted; none remain after rollback

---

## Phase 29 — Instance Super Admin & Multi-Tenant Provisioning ✅

Goal: introduce a lightweight "instance admin" concept that lets a single OpenHangar installation serve multiple independent tenants, while keeping the solo-user experience completely unchanged.

**Design principle:** the instance admin is infrastructure, not a resident. They provision tenants and handle emergencies, but do not need a seat inside every tenant. When only one tenant exists and the current user is both instance admin and tenant owner, the UI collapses into the familiar single-settings experience — no new concepts surface.

**Model changes:**
- [x] Add `is_instance_admin` boolean column (default `False`) to `User`; set to `True` for the very first user created (in the setup wizard)
- [x] Alembic migration for the new column - including handling the case where an existing admin needs to be upgrade to instance admin with this update
- [x] `require_instance_admin` decorator in `utils.py` (mirrors `login_required`; returns 403 if `current_user.is_instance_admin` is false)

**Setup wizard:**
- [x] After creating the first user, set `is_instance_admin = True` on that user — no UI change needed, happens silently

**Instance admin UI (visible only when `is_instance_admin`):**
- [x] "Tenants" section in the config/settings page, shown only when the logged-in user is instance admin; hidden for all other users regardless of their per-tenant role
- [x] Tenant list: name, creation date, number of users, number of aircraft, active/inactive status
- [x] Create tenant form: tenant name, operating model (reuse existing `TenantProfile` fields), admin email — creates the `Tenant`, its `TenantProfile`, and sends an invitation to the specified email as OWNER of that tenant
- [x] Deactivate / reactivate tenant: sets an `is_active` flag on `Tenant`; deactivated tenants cannot log in (enforced in `login_required` / session setup)
- [x] "Reset tenant admin password" action: instance admin can trigger a one-time password reset for any OWNER-role user of any tenant — generates a short-lived signed token (same mechanism as the existing invite flow) and displays it on screen (no email required, so the instance admin can relay it out-of-band); the token forces a password change on first use

**Solo-user guard:**
- [x] When `Tenant.query.count() == 1` and the logged-in user is that tenant's OWNER, the Tenants section is omitted from the settings page — no multi-tenant UI surfaces for a single-tenant install - do allow for a single user environment to upgrade to multi-tenant.

**Tests:**
- [x] `require_instance_admin` blocks non-instance-admin users with 403
- [x] Setup wizard sets `is_instance_admin` on the first user; subsequent users are not marked
- [x] Create tenant: new `Tenant` + `TenantProfile` + `UserInvitation` (OWNER role) are created; response redirects to tenant list
- [x] Deactivate tenant: subsequent login attempt by a user of that tenant is rejected
- [x] Password reset token: valid token forces password-change form; expired/used token is rejected; only instance admin can generate one
- [x] Solo-guard: Tenants section absent from settings when only one tenant exists

## Phase 30 — Airplane GPS Log Import ✅

Goal: allow a pilot or aircraft owner to upload a GPS track file (GPX from SkyDemon/ForeFlight or a Garmin GTN 750 CSV export), automatically derive flight segments from the track, create aircraft logbook entries, render a per-flight map, and optionally cross-populate the pilot logbook.

The reference files studied during design:
- **SkyDemon GPX**: standard GPX 1.1; `<trkseg>` with `<trkpt lat lon>`, `<ele>` (metres MSL), `<speed>` (m/s — *not* knots), `<time>` (UTC ISO-8601); 5-second sample interval; track `<name>` contains departure–arrival airport names e.g. `"EBNM NAMUR  Suarlée - EBAW ANTWERPEN  Deurne"`; speed is 0.0 during ground time
- **SkyDemon KML**: `gx:Track` format; timestamps in sub-millisecond UTC; coordinates in `lon lat alt` order (reversed from GPX); useful as a fallback but GPX is preferred
- **SkyDemon `.flightlog`**: proprietary binary format — not supported
- **Garmin GTN 750 CSV**: 3-row header — row 1 is `#airframe_info` metadata; row 2 is unit labels; row 3 is column names (`Lcl Date`, `Lcl Time`, `UTCOfst`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `AltMSL`, `GndSpd` in kt, `IAS`, `HDG`, `TRK`, `COM1`, `COM2`, `NAV1`, `NAV2`, `GPSfix`, plus 25+ other avionics channels); 1-second sample rate; early rows have blank lat/lon and `GPSfix = NoSoln` (GPS acquiring) — only rows with `GPSfix` of `3D` or `3DDiff` carry valid position; filename encodes departure ICAO: `log_YYMMDD_HHMMSS_ICAO.csv`

**Supported file formats:**
- [x] GPX 1.1 (SkyDemon, ForeFlight, most aviation apps) — primary format
- [x] Garmin GTN 750 / G1000 CSV — 3-row header, local time with UTC offset, `GndSpd` column in kt, only `3D`/`3DDiff` GPS-fix rows used
- [x] KML with `gx:Track` (SkyDemon secondary export) — parsed as fallback when GPX is unavailable
- [x] Format is auto-detected: `.gpx` → XML sniff for `<gpx`; `.csv` → sniff for `#airframe_info` on row 1; `.kml` → XML sniff for `<kml`; unsupported formats (e.g. `.flightlog`) rejected with a clear error
- [x] Upload form accepts multiple files simultaneously (`<input type="file" multiple>`); each file is parsed and classified independently, then all results are presented together in a single chronological review step

**Parsing specifics:**
- [x] GPX: extract `(lat, lon, elevation_m, speed_ms, time_utc)` per trackpoint; convert speed from m/s to kt (×1.944)
- [x] Garmin CSV: skip 3-header rows; combine `Lcl Date` + `Lcl Time` + `UTCOfst` into a UTC timestamp; use `Latitude` / `Longitude` / `AltMSL` / `GndSpd`; extract departure ICAO from filename if present; ignore all other columns (store a selection as raw metadata in the batch record for future use)
- [x] KML: parse `<when>` timestamps and `<gx:coord>` (lon lat alt); derive speed from consecutive point distance/time since no explicit speed field

**File classification (per file, before segment detection):**
- [x] After parsing, classify each file into one of three categories based on its speed profile:
  - `flight` — at least one continuous window of ≥ 30 s where ground speed exceeds 30 kt (clearly airborne)
  - `ground_movement` — ground speed never exceeds 30 kt for 30 s, but does exceed 5 kt at some point (taxiing, ground runs, fuel stop); this includes both "fuel-stop with engine off" files and "engine-start / PFD-boot before departure" files that have meaningful ground movement
  - `empty` — speed never exceeds 5 kt throughout the entire file (avionics started on a stationary aircraft, e.g. to export logs from a previous flight)
- [x] `empty` files are silently skipped; their filenames are noted in the import summary ("1 file skipped — no movement detected")
- [x] `ground_movement` files are merged with an adjacent `flight` file if the two files' time ranges are within 30 minutes of each other (i.e., the ground-movement file ends ≤ 30 min before a flight file starts, or starts ≤ 30 min after a flight file ends); when merged, the block-off/block-on of the combined entry extends to cover the ground-movement file's full time range
- [x] A `ground_movement` file with no adjacent flight within the 30-minute window is presented as a standalone entry with block-off/block-on from the file and 0 airborne time; labeled "Ground movement only" in the review UI; the user may keep it (creates a logbook entry with hobbs time but 0 flight time) or discard it

**Flight-segment detection:**
- [x] Merge all trackpoints into a chronological list; split into segments where ground speed stays below 30 kt for ≥ 5 minutes (GPX/KML sources have 5-second intervals; Garmin has 1-second intervals — apply the same logic)
- [x] For each segment: block-off = first trackpoint of segment; takeoff = first sample above 30 kt; landing = last sample above 30 kt; block-on = last trackpoint of segment — all four timestamps stored
- [x] Garmin-specific: only use rows with `GPSfix` in `{3D, 3DDiff}` for takeoff/landing detection; ignore `NoSoln` rows at start (GPS acquiring)
- [x] Present detected segments to the user for review before saving: show departure time, arrival time, raw duration, and the resolved ICAO codes; allow the user to edit ICAO codes and delete spurious segments (e.g. ground manoeuvring at taxi speed that is mis-detected as a flight); ground-movement-only entries are shown separately at the bottom of the review list

**ICAO airport resolution:**
- [x] Resolve the nearest ICAO airport to the first and last GPS fix of each segment using a bundled lightweight airport database (OurAirports `airports.csv`, filtered to ICAO-coded airports)
- [x] Accept match if the nearest airport is within 5 km; otherwise leave the field blank and prompt the user
- [x] GPX track name hint: parse `ICAO NAME — ICAO NAME` patterns from the SkyDemon track name as a secondary resolution signal

**Time rounding preference:**
- [x] Aircraft configuration page gains a **Logbook time precision** toggle: *1/10 h (6-minute increments, EASA standard)* vs. *1 minute* — default is 1/10 h
- [x] Flight duration = block-off to block-on; rounded up to the nearest applicable increment for the logbook entry; raw GPS duration stored separately
- [x] Example: 42 min raw → 0.7 h (1/10 h mode) or 42 min (minute mode); 39 min raw → 0.7 h (1/10 h, rounds up from 6.5 increments)

**Aircraft logbook entries:**
- [x] Each confirmed segment creates a flight entry linked to the aircraft: departure ICAO, block-off time, arrival ICAO, block-on time, duration (rounded), source = `"gps_import"`
- [x] `AircraftLogImportBatch` model: aircraft FK, filename, import timestamp, format detected, number of segments found/imported; rollback deletes all linked entries

**Pilot logbook cross-population:**
- [x] Checkbox on the import confirmation page: **"I was PIC for all flights in this file"** — creates a `PilotLogbookEntry` per segment with aircraft registration, type, departure/arrival ICAO, departure/arrival time, `function_pic` = duration; `single_pilot_se` or `single_pilot_me` set based on aircraft category; night/IFR/landing fields left blank for the pilot to complete
- [x] Created pilot entries belong to the same `AircraftLogImportBatch` and roll back together

**Per-flight map:**
- [x] Each segment's full track is stored as a GeoJSON `LineString` in the batch record (coordinates downsampled to ≤ 500 points if needed to limit storage)
- [x] Altitude and ground speed encoded as GeoJSON `properties` arrays for colour rendering
- [x] Aircraft detail page and flight entry page render the track on a Leaflet map; colour gradient by altitude (or ground speed if altitude unavailable)

**Cumulative aircraft map (foundation):**
- [x] Aircraft detail page gains a **Flight tracks** tab showing all stored tracks overlaid as semi-transparent polylines — visual weight accumulates on frequently-flown routes; this is the foundation for the FlySto-style heatmap in a later phase

**Tests:**
- [x] GPX parsing: speed conversion m/s→kt correct; trackpoints extracted with correct UTC times
- [x] Garmin CSV: 3-row header skipped; `NoSoln` rows excluded; UTC timestamp correctly assembled from `Lcl Date` + `Lcl Time` + `UTCOfst`; ICAO extracted from filename
- [x] KML parsing: `gx:coord` lon/lat order handled; speed derived from consecutive points
- [x] Multi-file upload: two files submitted together → both parsed; results merged into one chronological review list
- [x] File classification: file with speed always < 5 kt → `empty`, skipped; file with speed peaking at 20 kt → `ground_movement`; file with ≥ 30 s above 30 kt → `flight`
- [x] Ground-movement merging: `ground_movement` file ending 10 min before a `flight` file → merged into one entry with extended block-off; `ground_movement` file 2 hours before a flight → not merged, shown as standalone
- [x] Standalone ground entry: `ground_movement` file with no adjacent flight → review entry labeled "Ground movement only", creates 0-airborne-time logbook entry when confirmed
- [x] Flight-segment detection: single segment; two segments separated by ≥ 5 min ground stop
- [x] ICAO resolution: airport within 5 km matched; airport 10 km away returns no match
- [x] Time rounding: 42 min → 0.7 h (1/10 h mode); 42 min → 42 min (minute mode); 39 min → 0.7 h (rounds up)
- [x] PIC cross-population: pilot entries created with correct fields when checked; not created when unchecked
- [x] Rollback: all aircraft entries, pilot entries, and GeoJSON data deleted together
- [x] GeoJSON downsampling: track > 500 points is reduced; start and end points preserved

---

## Phase 31 — Unified Flight Entry: Other Aircraft & GPS Autofill ✅

Goal: allow pilots to log flights in aircraft not maintained in this OpenHangar instance, and make GPS data an optional autofill step on the manual flight form, so both entry paths (manual and GPS import) lead to the same set of outcomes (aircraft logbook entry, pilot logbook entry, GPS track) without requiring all three.

**"Other aircraft" for manual flight logging:**
- [x] The manual "Log a flight" form gains a toggle at the top: **"Aircraft not in this OpenHangar instance"**. When selected: free-text make / model / registration fields (stored in the existing `aircraft_type` and `aircraft_registration` columns on `PilotLogbookEntry`); no `FlightEntry` is created; only a `PilotLogbookEntry` is written
- [x] Pilot role is mandatory in this mode; the "Not flying" option is removed (nothing to record if you were not the pilot on an off-system aircraft)
- [x] When the toggle is off, form behaviour is unchanged from the current manual flow

**"Other aircraft" for GPS import:**
- [x] The GPS import upload page gains the same toggle
- [x] When selected: no `FlightEntry` is created; a `PilotLogbookEntry` is created from each confirmed segment's GPS data; GPS tracks are discarded after import (no aircraft to attach them to)
- [x] Pilot role (PIC / Dual+student) is mandatory; "Not flying" option is removed
- [x] Rollback deletes the `PilotLogbookEntry` records linked to the batch; no `FlightEntry` exists to unlink

**GPS autofill hint on manual flight form:**
- [x] When an aircraft is already selected on the "Log a flight" form, display a small callout: *"Have a GPS file for this flight? Upload it first — it will autofill times and route."* — links to the GPS import upload page with the aircraft pre-selected, skipping the aircraft-selector step
- [x] No new backend logic required; this is a UX cross-promotion only

**Tests:**
- [x] "Other aircraft" manual: submission with free-text aircraft fields → `PilotLogbookEntry` created, no `FlightEntry`; `aircraft_type` and `aircraft_registration` populated correctly
- [x] "Other aircraft" mandatory role: "Not flying" option absent in rendered form; submission without role selection rejected
- [x] "Other aircraft" GPS import: `PilotLogbookEntry` created from GPS data; no `FlightEntry`; GPS track not persisted to DB
- [x] "Other aircraft" GPS rollback: batch deletion removes the pilot logbook entries created by the batch
- [x] Normal aircraft selected: manual and GPS import behaviour unchanged from Phase 30
- [x] GPS autofill link: callout rendered when aircraft is selected; link href includes correct `aircraft_id` parameter

---

## Phase 31b — Unified Flight Entry: Full Integration

Goal: replace the separate aircraft-logbook and pilot-logbook creation flows with a single "Log a flight" form that writes both records in one operation, stores GPS tracks as a standalone model linkable from either log type, and makes duplicate detection a first-class concern throughout.

**Schema — GpsTrack model:**
- [ ] New `GpsTrack` model: `id`, `source_filename`, `block_off_utc`, `block_on_utc`, `departure_icao`, `arrival_icao`, `geojson` (JSON), `created_at`; no FK to aircraft or pilot — it is a free-standing record
- [ ] Add `gps_track_id` (nullable FK → `GpsTrack`) to `FlightEntry`; drop the existing `track_geojson` column (data migrated into new table)
- [ ] Add `gps_track_id` (nullable FK → `GpsTrack`) to `PilotLogbookEntry`
- [ ] Migration: for each `FlightEntry` where `track_geojson IS NOT NULL`, insert a `GpsTrack` row and back-fill the new FK; then drop the column

**Unified flight form (`/flights/new`):**
- [ ] New blueprint-level route (not under `/aircraft/` or `/pilot/`) accepting an optional `aircraft_id` query parameter for pre-selection
- [ ] Aircraft section: dropdown of managed aircraft owned by the current tenant + "Other aircraft" option that reveals free-text make/model and registration fields
- [ ] Optional GPS file upload (single file, single flight): on upload, parse the file server-side and return auto-filled date, departure/arrival ICAOs, and block times; user can override any auto-filled value
- [ ] Hobbs/tach counter fields: shown only when a managed aircraft is selected
- [ ] Pilot role selector: PIC / Dual / None — controls whether a `PilotLogbookEntry` is created; "None" is allowed when the pilot is an observer or wants aircraft-only logging
- [ ] Clear summary below the form showing what will be created: "Aircraft log entry" (only if managed aircraft) and/or "Pilot logbook entry" (only if PIC or Dual)
- [ ] Duplicate detection before submit: check for overlapping `block_off_utc`/`block_on_utc` (if GPS provided) or same date + departure + arrival ICAO on the same aircraft/pilot. If a match is found: show a warning identifying the existing entry, offer "Attach GPS track only" (no new record created, no time fields changed — existing logged times remain authoritative; a small notice is shown that GPS times differ if they do) or "Create anyway"
- [ ] When GPS is attached to an existing entry: store the `GpsTrack` and set the FK; do not overwrite `departure_time`, `arrival_time`, `flight_time`, or hobbs/tach fields; show inline notice if GPS timestamps differ from the logged values

**Edit form:**
- [ ] `/flights/<flight_entry_id>/edit`: same template as `/flights/new`, pre-populated from the `FlightEntry` and its linked `PilotLogbookEntry` (if any)
- [ ] `/pilot/logbook/<entry_id>/edit`: same template, pre-populated from the `PilotLogbookEntry` and its linked `FlightEntry` (if any, via `flight_id` FK)
- [ ] When both records are linked: saving updates both atomically; changing times on one side changes both
- [ ] Removing pilot role on edit: offer "detach pilot log entry" (keeps `PilotLogbookEntry` as standalone, clears `flight_id` FK) or "delete pilot log entry"

**GPS track for pilot-only log:**
- [ ] In "other aircraft" mode a GPS file can still be uploaded; `GpsTrack` is stored and linked via `PilotLogbookEntry.gps_track_id`; no `FlightEntry` is created

**Navigation entry points:**
- [ ] Navbar: "Log a flight" button linking to `/flights/new`, visible to all roles that can log flights (Owner, Admin, User/Renter)
- [ ] Aircraft detail page "Add flight" link → `/flights/new?aircraft_id=<id>`
- [ ] Pilot logbook "Add entry" link → `/flights/new` (no aircraft pre-selection)
- [ ] Existing `/aircraft/<id>/flights/new` and `/pilot/logbook/new` routes: remove; update all template links in place (no HTTP redirects)

**Mass GPS upload rework:**
- [ ] Keep the existing upload page and segment-review overview; update it to show per-segment duplicate detection results
- [ ] Replace the single "Confirm all" POST with per-segment actions: "Edit & confirm" (opens unified form at `/flights/new` pre-populated with parsed GPS data and segment details) and "Confirm as-is" (quick confirm for segments where auto-detected values need no correction, creates records without opening the form)
- [ ] The standalone `/aircraft/<id>/gps-import/confirm` POST endpoint is removed; confirmation now goes through the unified form

**Tests:**
- [ ] Unified form — managed aircraft + PIC: `FlightEntry` and `PilotLogbookEntry` both created and linked
- [ ] Unified form — managed aircraft + None role: `FlightEntry` created, no `PilotLogbookEntry`
- [ ] Unified form — other aircraft + PIC: `PilotLogbookEntry` created with free-text fields, no `FlightEntry`
- [ ] Unified form — GPS auto-fill: parsed values pre-populate form fields; user override persisted correctly
- [ ] Unified form — duplicate detected (GPS): warning shown; "attach only" sets `gps_track_id` without changing time fields; existing logged times preserved
- [ ] Unified form — duplicate detected (manual): warning shown on date+ICAO match; "create anyway" proceeds
- [ ] GPS track pilot-only: `GpsTrack` linked to `PilotLogbookEntry.gps_track_id`; no `FlightEntry` created
- [ ] Edit — linked pair: changing flight time updates both `FlightEntry` and `PilotLogbookEntry`
- [ ] Edit — remove pilot role → detach: `PilotLogbookEntry.flight_id` cleared; entry still exists standalone
- [ ] Edit — remove pilot role → delete: `PilotLogbookEntry` deleted; `FlightEntry` unchanged
- [ ] Mass upload — "Edit & confirm" opens unified form with correct pre-fill
- [ ] Mass upload — "Confirm as-is" creates records via same logic as unified form
- [ ] Migration: existing `FlightEntry.track_geojson` rows migrated to `GpsTrack`; FK back-filled; column dropped
- [ ] Navbar: "Log a flight" link rendered for Owner/Admin/Renter; absent for Viewer
- [ ] Old entry point URLs removed: `aircraft.new_flight` and `pilot.new_logbook_entry` routes no longer exist; all template links updated

---

## Phase 32 — Shared Ownership

Goal: support an aircraft jointly owned by multiple individuals, each holding a defined share percentage, with proportional cost apportionment and downloadable owner statements.

**Ownership model:**
- [ ] `AircraftOwner` model — aircraft FK, user FK, share percentage; validated so shares sum to 100 % per aircraft; editable by Owner role
- [ ] Aircraft detail page shows the ownership breakdown (name and share percentage per co-owner)

**Billing & reconciliation:**
- [ ] Co-owner billing dashboard — compute chargeable hours × hourly rate, apportion total costs by share, show running balance per co-owner
- [ ] Manual reconciliation: record a payment against a co-owner's balance (amount, date, free-text note)
- [ ] Downloadable co-owner statement (CSV/PDF): period, hours flown, costs due, payments recorded, closing balance; header records export date and exporter name

**Tests:**
- [ ] Share validation: shares must sum to 100 %; partial assignments rejected
- [ ] Apportionment: known hours × rate → per-owner amounts match expected shares
- [ ] Statement export: correct totals, correct per-owner rows, metadata present

---

## Phase 33 — Flying Club

Goal: support the flying-club operating model, where the club is the sole aircraft owner and members share access under a common membership structure.

**Membership:**
- [ ] `ClubMembership` model — tenant FK, user FK, membership type (Full / Student / Honorary), valid_from, valid_until, annual_fee
- [ ] Membership management UI — list active and expired members, add or renew membership, suspend a member
- [ ] Membership expiry enforced: expired members cannot log new flights or create reservations (Phase 22)

**Club billing:**
- [ ] Member-specific hourly rates per aircraft (e.g. full-member rate vs. student rate)
- [ ] Monthly billing summary per member: flights, total hours, charges at applicable rate, membership dues; downloadable statement

**Dev seed:**
- [ ] Club-mode seed: one tenant with three members and two shared aircraft

**Tests:**
- [ ] Membership expiry: expired member blocked from booking and flight logging, but can still view their past billing information
- [ ] Billing: correct rate applied per membership type; summary totals accurate

---

## Phase 34 — Flying School

Goal: support the flight-school operating model, where instructors deliver dual-instruction flights to students, with per-student progress tracking and instructor-specific permissions. The same model covers independent instructors operating on a single aircraft with a small number of private students — no formal school structure required.

**Instructor role:**
- [ ] New **Instructor** role: can approve flight log entries, record dual-instruction flights, and view all student logbooks within the tenant
- [ ] Instructor assignment per aircraft: only assigned instructors may approve solo reservations for that aircraft (builds on Phase 22 approval workflow)

**Student role:**
- [ ] New **Student** role, distinct from Pilot/Renter: students cannot create reservations independently — all bookings (dual sessions and supervised solo flights) must be initiated or approved by an assigned instructor
- [ ] Instructor sign-off required on solo flight entries for students: flight is marked pending until an instructor countersigns (free text + timestamp)

**Student management:**
- [ ] `StudentProfile` model — user FK, training programme (e.g. PPL / LAPL / IR), assigned instructor FK, start_date, target_hours
- [ ] Student progress view: hours logged (dual / solo / total), distance to licence target, list of qualifying flights

**Dual-instruction flights:**
- [ ] Dual-instruction entry in the aircraft logbook automatically creates paired `PilotLogbookEntry` records for both the student (SP) and the instructor (IP)

**Dev seed:**
- [ ] School-mode seed: one tenant with two instructors, four students at different stages, and a mixed history of dual and solo flights

**Tests:**
- [ ] Student role: cannot create a reservation without instructor; booking blocked after instructor unassigned
- [ ] Instructor role: can approve entries and record dual flights; cannot modify aircraft configuration
- [ ] Student progress: hour totals and solo/dual split are accurate
- [ ] Paired logbook entries: dual flight creates correct SP and IP entries

---

## Phase 35 — Pilot Logbook Auto-population

Goal: auto-populate the pilot logbook from aircraft logbook entries so that
logging a flight on the aircraft form fills both logbooks in one step.

**Auto-population from `FlightEntry`:**
- [ ] When a `FlightEntry` is saved with a registered crew member, automatically create or update the corresponding `PilotLogbookEntry`
- [ ] Derivation rules:
  - Aircraft fields ← `FlightEntry.aircraft` (type, registration)
  - Times ← `FlightEntry` (departure/arrival place and time from Phase 16)
  - `pic_name` ← `FlightCrew[role=PIC]` for that flight
  - `total_flight_time` ← `FlightEntry.flight_time`
  - Function column ← mapped from the holder's `FlightCrew.role` (PIC→function_pic, COPILOT→function_copilot, SP→function_dual, IP→function_instructor)
  - Single vs multi engine ← derived from aircraft engine count in the `Component` table
- [ ] All auto-filled values remain editable by the pilot before saving

**Unified flight entry form:**
- [ ] The aircraft flight entry form (Phase 16) gains a "My logbook" collapsible section when the logged-in user appears in the crew list — pilot-specific fields (night/instrument time, function) appear alongside the aircraft fields
- [ ] On save: `FlightEntry` + one `PilotLogbookEntry` per registered crew member created atomically
- [ ] Linked entries in the pilot logbook view show a link icon to the corresponding aircraft logbook entry

**Dev seed:**
- [ ] Linked entries auto-created from existing seed `FlightEntry` records (including at least one IP+SP dual entry)

**Tests:**
- [ ] Auto-population: `FlightEntry` save → correct `PilotLogbookEntry` derived fields for all columns
- [ ] Function mapping: each `FlightCrew` role maps to the correct function column
- [ ] Single vs multi engine derivation from aircraft component configuration
- [ ] Unified form: pilot logbook section appears when logged-in user is in crew list; hidden otherwise
- [ ] Atomic save: `FlightEntry` rollback also rolls back the `PilotLogbookEntry`

---

## Phase 36 — Photo EXIF & Arrival Time Auto-fill

Goal: extract the arrival time automatically from counter photos so pilots
don't need to type it in after every flight.

**EXIF timestamp extraction:**
- [ ] On counter photo upload, extract EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` tag → suggest as arrival time (converted to UTC, floored to nearest 0.1 h); user can accept or override
- [ ] If EXIF tags are absent, attempt to parse a timestamp from the original filename (common patterns: `IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss`, `YYYY-MM-DD HH.mm.ss`, etc.) as a fallback
- [ ] No OCR of counter values yet (tracked in [`docs/backlog.md`](backlog.md))

**Tests:**
- [ ] Known-good JPEG with EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` → correct UTC arrival suggestion, floored to 0.1 h
- [ ] JPEG with stripped EXIF but timestamp in filename → correct fallback suggestion
- [ ] JPEG with neither EXIF nor recognisable filename → no suggestion, no error

---

## Phase 37 — Offline Mobile Sync & Telemetry Import

Goal: allow data entry when connectivity is unreliable and enrich logs with GPS/ADS-B data.

- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest and service worker for offline caching of the flight-entry form
- [ ] Local IndexedDB queue for offline flight entries; sync to server on reconnect
- [ ] GPX / IGC file import — parse track, auto-fill departure/arrival ICAO, compute flight time equivalent from elapsed time
- [ ] ADS-B CSV import (e.g. from OpenSky) — match by registration, create FlightEntries
- [ ] Duplicate detection on import (same date + departure + arrival already exists)
- [ ] Dev seed: one aircraft with an imported GPX track attached to a flight entry
- [ ] Route tests: import endpoints, duplicate detection, sync conflict resolution

---

## Phase 38 — External Integrations

Goal: connect OpenHangar to the tools operators already use.

- [ ] ICS calendar export — one feed URL per aircraft, includes reservations and maintenance due dates
- [ ] Webhook outbox — configurable POST on key events (flight logged, maintenance overdue, reservation confirmed)
- [ ] Accounting CSV export — standard format (date, description, amount, VAT rate) for fuel and parts
- [ ] Parts vendor search — configurable URL template per aircraft type; "find part" link from maintenance trigger detail
- [ ] Route tests: ICS feed structure, webhook delivery, accounting CSV columns

---

## Phase 39 — Email Notifications

Goal: proactively alert owners about upcoming and overdue maintenance.

- [ ] `NotificationSetting` model — tenant-level thresholds (usage %, days-before, stored in DB)
- [ ] Background job / scheduler (APScheduler or similar) wired into the container
- [ ] Monthly summary email — items due in next 3 months
- [ ] 90 % usage warning email for hours-based triggers
- [ ] 7-day reminder for calendar-based hard times
- [ ] Immediate overdue alert when threshold is exceeded
- [ ] Extend dev seed with notification settings pre-configured for the seed tenant

---

## Phase 40 — Advanced Reporting & Exports

Goal: give owners and clubs actionable summaries they can share or archive.

- [ ] Airframe / engine / propeller logbook PDF export (per aircraft or per component)
- [ ] Cost report PDF — period-selectable, grouped by type, with cost-per-hour
- [ ] Fleet health summary — one-page printable status sheet for all aircraft
- [ ] CSV export for expenses, flight entries, and maintenance triggers
- [ ] Pilot currency matrix — table of all pilots vs. currency checks (SEP, night, medical)
- [ ] Route tests: export endpoints return correct content-type and non-empty payloads
- [ ] Quick handover pack — per-aircraft snapshot for handover/notice boards:
  - Generates a one‑page web view and a printable PDF containing: aircraft status colour, current hobbs/engine hours, last 5 flights (date/route/hours), open snags (grounding first), next 5 maintenance items, and links to essential non-sensitive documents.
  - This one-page/PDF can be publicly shared, this is defined at the aircraft level (default: turned off)
  - If public sharing enabled: create a printable QR code (PNG) that links to the aircraft's public PDF or web snapshot; QR + very short instructions packaged in a sized PDF suitable for printing and attaching to the aircraft (e.g., cockpit placard).
  - Share-link / PDF respects document visibility (sensitive docs excluded) and enforces token access for full views.
  - Route tests: snapshot web view renders, PDF generation returns correct content-type and includes expected sections, QR resolves to correct tokenized share URL, and printable PDF layout fits standard paper sizes.
- [ ] Export official-format logbook to Excel — per-pilot or per-aircraft XLSX export that maps fields to the jurisdiction‑specific official logbook columns (EASA / FAA mode), preserves column types/headers, includes running totals and export metadata (exporter, timestamp, tenant), and respects privacy/visibility rules (sensitive docs/entries excluded).
- [ ] **Download all aircraft information as ZIP** — per-aircraft archive bundling: PDF airframe/engine/propeller logbook exports, current maintenance snapshot (PDF), open snags list, cost summary, and all accessible documents (Phase 27 visibility rules); served as `aircraft-<reg>-export-<date>.zip`; respects role-based visibility (sensitive documents excluded for non-owners)

## Phase 41 — Hosted SaaS & Advanced RBAC

Goal: support a multi-tenant hosted offering with fine-grained permissions and full audit trail.

- [ ] Tenant self-registration flow — sign-up, email verification, first-user bootstrapping
- [ ] Advanced roles: Mechanic (write maintenance records, read-only flights), CAMO (approve maintenance closures), Safety Manager (read-all, no write), Instructor (manage reservations + pilot logbooks)
- [ ] Audit log — append-only table recording every write operation (who, what, when, before/after snapshot)
- [ ] Audit log viewer in Configuration page — filterable by user, model, date range
- [ ] Tenant data export (GDPR) — owner can download all tenant data as a ZIP archive
- [ ] Tenant deletion with cascading wipe and confirmation guard
- [ ] Usage metering hooks (seat count, storage bytes) — foundation for future billing integration
- [ ] Route tests: role enforcement for each new role, audit log completeness, data-export contents
